# Information theory project

This project implements information theory concepts in Java. It reads three `.txt` files in different languages and performs character calculations, probability distribution analysis, entropy calculations, pair analysis, Shannon-Fano encoding, and fixed-length code generation through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

-   Reading `.txt` files in multiple languages.
-   Character frequency calculation.
-   Probability distribution analysis.
-   Entropy calculation.
-   Pair counting and distribution.
-   Common and conditional entropy calculation.
-   Fixed length code generation.
-   Shannon-Fano encoding.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/panoschron97/Information_theory_project.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Information_theory_project
    ```

## Usage

1.  Run the compiled Java program:

    ```bash
    javac Icsd15222_information_theory.java
    ```
    ```bash
    java Icsd15222_information_theory
    ```

    This will execute the main class and launch the menu-driven interface.

2.  Follow the on-screen instructions to load files and perform information theory calculations.

## Dependencies

-   [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) - Version 8 or later.
